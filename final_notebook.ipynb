    "# Overview\n",
    "This project analyzes the Ramen Ratings dataset from Kaggle. This dataset has a few thousand ramen products and their ratings, from 0 to 5 stars. The data includes the review number, the ramen's brand, product name, packaging style, country of origin, rating, and whether or not the ramen is in the top 10. I chose to make this a one-vs-rest classification problem on whether a ramen is rated five stars or not. The analysis uses independence tests and feature engineering to arrive at key drivers of five-star ratings, then uses these features to build a predictive model. The project successfully identified key drivers using these methods and build a predictive model that performs better than a standard baseline for the work.\n",

    "## The cool new stuff I accomplished for this project\n",
    "- **Heavy keyword engineering**\n",
    "    * Domain research to understand ramen products based on keyword\n",
    "    * Translation to bring all keywords to consistent categories\n",
    "    * Categorization on common factors based on domain research and translation\n",
    "- **Multi-layered statistical testing to eliminate features**\n",
    "    * Chi-Square tests to eliminate initial features that are not related to target\n",
    "    * One-hot encoding of remaining features' categories\n",
    "    * Chi-Square tests to eliminate one-hot-encoded categories that are not related to target\n",
    "- **Clustering country and keyword features into low-, medium-, and high-rate five-star ratings groups**\n",
    "    * Checked proportions of five-star rating counts against not-five-star rating counts for True in encoded feature\n",
    "    * Checked proportions of five-star rating counts against not-five-star rating counts for False in encoded feature\n",
    "    * Compared five-star proportions to check increase/decrease in proportion from False to True\n",
    "    * Bracketed increasing, middle, and decreasing proportions from False to True\n",
    "    \n",
    "## Other stuff that I've done before\n",
    "- Wrangle\n",
    "    * Categorize and encode target into five_stars column (classes: is five-stars, isn't five stars)\n",
    "    * Fix some values, drop some nulls, outliers, and duplicate rows, get rid of unnecessary columns\n",
    "    * Create univariate visualizations\n",
    "- Explore\n",
    "    * Run Chi-Square testing to determine if feature is related to target\n",
    "    * Feature engineering (overall)\n",
    "    * Create bivariate visualizations\n",
    "    * Choose features for model\n",
    "- Model\n",
    "    * Choose optimization priorities for the model (F1 Score)\n",
    "    * Resample the target to address class imbalance\n",
    "    * Create baseline model and multiple algorithmic models with varying hyperparameter combinations\n",
    "    * Evaluate models on Validate (first out-of-sample split)\n",
    "    * Choose best model in terms of our optimization priority\n",
    "    * Calculate ROC AUC of baseline and best model\n",
    "    * Evaluate baseline and best model on Test split\n",
    "    \n",

Some of these keyword-engineering features were statistically related to our target and used in the model. In the end, our predictive model outperformed the baseline on common evaluation metrics."
