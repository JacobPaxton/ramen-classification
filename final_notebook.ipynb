    "- **Heavy keyword engineering**\n",
    "    * Domain research to understand ramen products based on keyword\n",
    "    * Translation to bring all keywords to consistent categories\n",
    "    * Categorization on common factors based on domain research and translation\n",
    "- **Multi-layered statistical testing to eliminate features**\n",
    "    * Chi-Square tests to eliminate initial features that are not related to target\n",
    "    * One-hot encoding of remaining features' categories\n",
    "    * Chi-Square tests to eliminate one-hot-encoded categories that are not related to target\n",
    "- **Clustering country and keyword features into low-, medium-, and high-rate five-star ratings groups**\n",
    "    * Checked proportions of five-star rating counts against not-five-star rating counts for True in encoded feature\n",
    "    * Checked proportions of five-star rating counts against not-five-star rating counts for False in encoded feature\n",
    "    * Compared five-star proportions to check increase/decrease in proportion from False to True\n",
    "    * Bracketed increasing, middle, and decreasing proportions from False to True\n",

    "## Other stuff that I've done before\n",
    "- Categorize and encode target into five_stars column (classes: is five-stars, isn't five stars)\n",
    "- Fix some values, drop some nulls, outliers, and duplicate rows, get rid of unnecessary columns\n",
    "- Create univariate visualizations\n",
    "- Run Chi-Square testing to determine if feature is related to target\n",
    "- Feature engineering (overall)\n",
    "- Create bivariate visualizations\n",
    "- Choose features for model\n",
    "- Choose optimization priorities for the model (F1 Score)\n",
    "- Resample the target to address class imbalance\n",
    "- Create baseline model and multiple algorithmic models with varying hyperparameter combinations\n",
    "- Evaluate models on Validate (first out-of-sample split)\n",
    "- Choose best model in terms of our optimization priority\n",
    "- Calculate ROC AUC of baseline and best model\n",
    "- Evaluate baseline and best model on Test split"
